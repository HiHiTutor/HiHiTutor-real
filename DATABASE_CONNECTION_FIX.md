# Database Connection Fix for Vercel Serverless Functions

## Problem
The application was experiencing "Database not ready" errors when trying to update tutor profiles in the Vercel serverless environment. The MongoDB connection was not being properly established or maintained between requests.

## Root Cause
In Vercel serverless functions, each API call can create a new instance, and the MongoDB connection might not be established before processing requests that require database access.

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced Database Connection Logic (`backend/config/db.js`)
- Added `ensureConnection()` function that ensures database connection before processing requests
- Improved connection state checking and waiting logic
- Added proper error handling for connection timeouts

### 2. Database Middleware (`backend/middleware/dbMiddleware.js`)
- Created middleware to ensure database connection for all API routes
- Skips database check for health check endpoints
- Provides consistent error responses for connection failures

### 3. Updated Controllers
- Modified `updateTutorProfile` function in both backend controllers to use `ensureConnection()`
- Replaced manual connection checking with the new robust connection logic

### 4. Updated App Configuration (`backend/app.js`)
- Added database middleware to critical API routes
- Ensures database connection before processing any database-dependent requests

## Files Modified
- `backend/config/db.js` - Enhanced connection logic
- `backend/middleware/dbMiddleware.js` - New database middleware
- `backend/app.js` - Added middleware to routes
- `backend/controllers/tutorController.js` - Updated to use ensureConnection
- `hihitutor/backend/controllers/tutorController.js` - Updated to use ensureConnection

## Testing
- Created `backend/test-db-connection.js` for testing database connectivity
- The fix ensures that database connections are established before processing any requests

## Expected Result
The "Database not ready" error should be resolved, and tutor profile updates should work properly in the Vercel serverless environment.
